# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS REPOSITORY

In GitHub, files are stored in _repositories_ (often called "repos", for short), which are public and can be viewed by anybody. However, changes to the original files can only be made or approved (after a **pull request**) by the **owners** of the repositories.

To obtain a complete carbon-copy of the files in this repository, simply click `download ZIP` and GitHub will send you the download of the latest version in a folder with the repository name (in this case, `hea_za_spreadsheets`).

Github will not track the individual changes in Excel files. So, if a file is edited, the _entire_ file will have to be committed back to the repo, not just the changes. This is totally painful but is a shortcoming of using spreadsheets, which are a completely innapropriate tool for data storage in the 21st Century!

If you want to work on the files and change them you will have to **fork** the repository to create a new _branch_. Then you **clone** the file you want to work on to your new branch (always include `za_expandabilityfactors.xlsx` in the clone) and then, if you and the owner are happy with you changes, you can do a **pull request** to _merge_ the two files together.

I am busy working on some VBA to install in each spreadsheet to automatically re-write the entire thing JSON, which is a _much_ better format. The results will look something like the JSON files in the `livelihoods` repo. While the JSON file might not at first appear as user-friendly as an Excel file does in Excel itself --I mean, who still has Excel installed on their computers anyway? Can you view an Excel spreadsheet on your phone or other device?-- it will allow easy web and app development, ultimately leading to scaled-out public sharing of HEA data.
